# Atmel Studio development environment test
These tests are geared towards using Atmel proprietary hardware tools, STK500, JTAGICE mkII, etc.

While some tools can be driven with open software programs (eg AVRdude), complete control requires the use of Atmel Studio.

Atmel Studio 7 (today Microchip Studio), is free, closed source, and based on MS Visual Studio.
